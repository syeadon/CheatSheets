# Cmder Keyboard Shortcuts

Despite many shortcuts I'm using frequently, the following ones can come in very handy but I'm often forgetting they even exist.

| Shortcut               | Description                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ctrl` + `L`		     | Clear terminal                              |
| `ctrl` + `R`		     | Reverse search                              |
| `Win` + `Delete`	     | Reset terminal                              |
| `Aps` + `Insert`	     | Paste path from clipboard in unix format    |
| `Apps` + `â†’`		     | Move cmder to next monitor                  |
