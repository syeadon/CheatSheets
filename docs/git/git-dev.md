## Revert unstaged files

If you have unstaged (not in the index) files and you want rid of them all

    git restore *
    
## Revert a single unstaged file

If you have unstaged file and you want rid of it

    git restore ./myfile.ext

---

## Remove a file from a un published commit

Stage the previous commit

    git reset --soft HEAD^ 

or

    git reset --soft HEAD~1

Then reset the unwanted files in order to leave them out from the commit:

    git reset -- path/to/unwanted_file

or if you want to undo the changes in that file    

    git reset HEAD path/to/unwanted_file

Now commit again, you can even re-use the same commit message:

    git commit -c ORIG_HEAD

## Undo

Link to a git [undo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/numerous_undo_possibilities_in_git/) resource.

## Push new local branch to remote

When you have a new local branch which is tracking nothing,  you can do an initail push to an as yet null remote branch. Note the **-u** shorhand for **--set-upstream**

  	git push -u origin feature/name

---

## Delete local tracking copies of the remotes

    git remote update origin --prune

---

## Delete local branches where the remote has gone

Use carefully this forcibly deletes branches regardless or their merge status see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7726949/remove-tracking-branches-no-longer-on-remote

    git fetch -p && git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch -D

---

## Stop tracking a remote

This will stop your local branch from tracking a remote

    git branch --unset-upstream

---


## Stash

### Save files to a stash with a message

    git stash save blah blah blah

### Save untracked files to a stash

    git stash --include-untracked

### List files changed in a stash

    git stash show

---


## Tags

### Add tag to specific commit

    git tag -a v[version] [hash] -m "your tag description"

---


## Revert a pushed --amend commit

See [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1459150/how-to-undo-git-commit-amend-done-instead-of-git-commit/1459264) for full credit


### Get the last x local commits,  should contain your (amend)

    git reflog -5

### Reset to just before your (amend)

    git reset <SHA BEFORE THE AMEND> --soft 

### You will now see all the changes in the commit and the amend undone
    git status

### Save ALL the changes to the stash
    git stash

### Get the latest from the remote tracking branch
    git pull origin <YOUR REMOTE BRANCH> --ff-only

### If you want to see that you have the commit you didn't want to amend
    git log
    git log --all --author="Stephen Yeadon" --pretty=format

### Retrieve our changes
    git stash pop

### Now you can create your new unamended commit
    git commit -m
